# Water-Tank

## Overview

This project is an automatic water level sensor system that monitors and controls the water level in a tank. When the water level is low, the system automatically fills the tank. The project is implemented using a Raspberry Pi Pico W board and programmed in C.

## Components

- Raspberry Pi Pico W
- Ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04)
- Relay module
- Water pump
- Jumper wires
- Breadboard
- Power supply

## Features

- Automatically detects the water level in the tank
- Turns on the water pump when the tank is empty
- Turns off the water pump when the tank is full
- Real-time monitoring of water levels
